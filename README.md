# ArCoreSamples
Results of playing with ARCore sample code by Google, Unity and poor blender skills.

### FormulaAR
This sample is remix of default ARCore sample from Google. Original controller script was modified to allow anchor object to plane only once (after losing tracking process has to be restarted). Car can be controled with joystick on left.
